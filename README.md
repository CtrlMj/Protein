CBC with diff
● CMP
● Fasting Insulin: Also known as an insulin test, this test evaluates insulin production by
the beta cells in your pancreas. It identifies insulin resistance and looks at the need for
certain diabetics to start taking insulin.
● C-Peptide: Another test for insulin levels in the blood, the C-peptide test, distinguishes
between the insulin produced by the pancreas and insulin from other sources.
● High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP): This substance is usually a response to
inflammation. Compared to the standard CRP test, this test can offer insights into your
risk for cardiovascular disease.
● Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG): Also known as a glucose test. It measures the glucose
level in your blood, which is moderated by your body’s ability to produce insulin. Too
much glucose may indicate that your body isn’t responding to insulin. Too little is also
problematic because your cells need glucose to function.
● Hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c): This test estimates your glucose levels over the past three
months. It helps determine how well your body is managing glucose.
● Homocysteine: Elevated homocysteine levels can indicate a vitamin B deficiency (B6,
B9, B12, or folate). Abnormally high homocysteine is a marker for increased risk of
cardiovascular disease.
● Folate: Low folate (B9) levels can lead to anemia and other health issues. This test looks
at the most bioavailable form of B9 in your blood.
● Fatty acids profile: Sometimes referred to as an RBC linoleic acid content test (or
“OmegaCheck®️“), this test looks at the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in your blood.
Excess omega-6 fatty acids (especially linoleic acid) are connected with inflammation
and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases
● Thyroid Panel: Free and total T3/T4, TSH, reverseT3, antithyroglobulin antibody,
anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody. Some thyroid panels only include some of the tests
listed above.
● Hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (FSH/LH), free/total
testosterone, DHEA-S, estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, sex hormone binding globulin
(SHBG), and AM cortisol. You will need to specifically request each hormone test
because no standard panel covers all of them
● Lipid Panel: Also known as a cholesterol panel, this test looks at the specific fat
molecules in your blood. It includes HDL/LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels
● Uric Acid
● Calcium (total and ionized)
● Vitamins and Minerals ( Especially D, All Bs if not covered by previous, Magnesium,
Phosphorus, etc.)
